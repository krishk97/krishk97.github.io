I am currently a PhD Student at [Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) advised by [Prof. Guha Balakrishnan](https://www.guhabalakrishnan.com/). My primary research interests are developing *responsible computer vision systems*. In particular, I am investigating novel methods to better evaluate black-box vision models and their learned feature representations. In [F?D](/publication/causal-fid), we perform a causal analysis linking differences in semantic attributes and distortions between face image distributions to Fr√©chet distances in deep feature spaces. In [GELDA](/publication/gelda), we develop an automatic annotation framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to discover visual biases in real datasets and image generators. 

Prior to joining Rice University, I completed my B.S. in Physics and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA. Outside of research and academia, I enjoy soccer (avid Chelsea F.C. fan), squash, bouldering, video games, and listening to music and podcasts.  

## Updates
* I will be interning at Adobe Research this summer! 
* 2 papers ([1](/publication/gelda), [2](/publication/causal-fid)) accepted at the Responsible Generative AI Workshop at CVPR 2024!
